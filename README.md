## How to Setup Passwordless SSH Login.

[source from](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-setup-passwordless-ssh-login/)

To set up a passwordless SSH login in Linux :generate a public authentication key and append it to the remote hosts ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
* Check for existing SSH key pair.
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*.pub
```
* Copy the public key to the server.
```bash
ssh-copy-id remote_username@server_ip_address
```
Once the user is authenticated, the public key will be appended to the remote user authorized_keys file and connection will be closed.
